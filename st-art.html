            We started out with a competitor analysis to determine the strengths and weaknesses of the competitors within the market. Is essential to look at the market from the customer's viewpoint and group all the competitors. Once the competitors have been grouped, I started to analyze their strategies and identified the areas where they are most vulnerable.
            </p>
            <p>
              The three main competitors for this project were Singulart, Artland, and Affortable Art Fair.
            </p>
            <p>
              The SWOT analysis was the useful technique we have used to understand the competitors's Strengths and Weaknesses and to identify both the opportunities and potential threats for my product.

<p>
I have joined St-Art from the initial steps when we were still concepting the project brief. The core team was pretty much in place, with directors of business development,one UX designer and marketing already on board. However, having background in Graphic design,simioutaniously with the UX design webapp development, I was able to be responsible for the design deliverables for St-Art's marketing campaign.
  After we have fortified the domain name we started to design our logo. My role was to identify the Brand style, colors and to follow the Arial Typography Font.
  The Brand name is a play of words and consists of the letters St-Art and the "Vertical bar" that divides the Art from Start. The vertical bar has no start and end as it is continuously developing and creating different shapes depending on the circumstances.
