  <h1>About</h1>
  <p>I am Sofia, a Certified UX Designer by following an intensive 10 months UX Design Specialization course from Careerfoundry.<br>
    I have a BS degree in Graphic design being experienced mainly on logos, packaging, and illustrations. I feel eager to continuously expand my knowledge on new topics; my exploitations thrive when satisfied customers provide positive feedback and
    become loyal.<br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    This perception led me to the UX Design process for enhancing human pleasure and product evolution, stretching design potential and simultaneously rendering customers satisfaction total. I have expanded my experiences into digital projects
    related to Usability, Accessibility, User experience, User Interface, HTML Basics, and Mobile First Design.
    I currently work on a real-world project named Ink Tank and it is all about the tattoo industry.<br>
    My responsibility was to create the design for an entire web responsive app from scratch. I have gained knowledge of how to approach, understand the real problems and design better solutions for the product's audience.
